#### Summary:
This project contains code and visualizations where possible for various unsupervised learning techniques in R and Python. The goal is to provide examples and reference code / visualizations for unsupervised learning techniques.

Techniques included: clustering, principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (TSNE), association rules

Clustering algorithms included: kmeans, hierarchical, expectation maximization, spectral. 

Relevant supporting info and plots are provided where possible.

#### Motivation:
I created this project to learn about and document code and visualizations for unsupervised learning techniques.

#### Contents:
The R and Python analyses are located in the "R" and "Python" branches respectively. In both branches, contents are divided into sections for clustering, association rules, and dimension reduction and component analysis. Otherwise, contents are intuitively named.

#### Dataset Details:
I generate all data depending on the technique being used.
